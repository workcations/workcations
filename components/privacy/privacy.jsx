    </div>
    <br />
    <div>

    <br />
    <h2>COOKIES</h2>
    <div>
      To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use
      “cookies”, or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign
      each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification (User ID) to
      understand the user’s individual interests using the Identified Computer.
      Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for
      example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a
      cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can
      contain is information you supply (an example of this is when you ask for
      our Personalised Horoscope). A cookie cannot read data off your hard
      drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your browser
      (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not control.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your
      computer’s connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you
      visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached
      to the Internet know where to send you data — such as the web pages you
      view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this
      information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our
      site to the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our site and
      let advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors
      come.
    </div>
    <br />
    <h2>LINKS TO THE OTHER SITES</h2>
    <div>
      Our policy discloses the privacy practices for our own web site only. Our
      site provides links to other websites also that are beyond our control. We
      shall in no way be responsible in a way for your use of such sites.
    </div>
    <br />
    <h2>INFORMATION SHARING</h2>
    <div>
      We share the sensitive personal information to any third party without
      obtaining the prior consent of the user in the following limited
      circumstances:
      <ol type="i">
        <li>
          When it is requested or required by law or by any court or
          governmental agency or authority to disclose, for the purpose of
          verification of identity, or for the prevention, detection,
          investigation including cyber incidents, or for prosecution and
          punishment of offenses. These disclosures are made in good faith and
          belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for enforcing
          these Terms; for complying with the applicable laws and regulations.
        </li>
        <li>
          We propose to share such information within its group companies and
          officers and employees of such group companies for the purpose of
          processing personal information on its behalf. We also ensure that
          these recipients of such information agree to process such information
          based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy
          and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <br />
    <h2>INFORMATION SECURITY</h2>
    <div>
      We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized
      access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
      These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and
      processing practices and security measures, including appropriate
      encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized
      access to systems where we store personal data.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      All information gathered on our Website is securely stored within our
      controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a
      firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly
      limited. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security
      system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database,
      nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted
      while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any
      information you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available
      to anyone with Internet access.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      However, the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our
      Privacy Policy from time to time to incorporate necessary future changes.
      Of course, our use of any information we gather will always be consistent
      with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of
      what the new policy may be.
