            The glory, history, and rich culture of Pushkar do not need any
            introduction. This ancient town located in Rajasthan has been
            popularly known for its spiritual significance, as a very rare Lord
            Brahma temple is located here. The local cafes serving lip-smacking
            dishes, annual cattle fair, the holy lake, and adventure activities
            make it a perfect place to stay for a Work and Vacation. <br />
            <br />
            What would be better than having a view of the Bhrama Lake from your
            Workstation, and getting the hippy vibes with a touch of royal
            culture of Rajasthan? <br />
            <br />
            Reasons, why you should take a break and plan a Workation in
            Pushkar.

            must visit the Savitri Temple. You can choose to hike or book
            yourself a cable car.
