            Not only Pauri's pristine beauty but the breathtaking view of dusks
            enchants tourists. Situated at the height of 1814 m in the Garhwal
            region, this beautiful hill station is surrounded by lush forests,
            waterfalls, spiritual places, and whatnot.
            <br />
            <br />
            Pauri is the perfect destination for taking a break from the humdrum
            affairs of the normal life and plan a workation to get a chance to
            work with a peaceful surrounding.

            Pauri offers good internet connectivity but is far too away from the
            hush of metro life! It's calm, serene and a place you'll find mostly
            in the novels! All in all, a great place to retrieve your lost peace
            of mind.

            There's something miraculous about Uttarakhand! Maybe it's the
            belief of locals in their deities, such that there is always an air
            of positivity around! <br />
            <br />
            At Pauri, you can seek blessings at Tarkeshwar Mahadev Temple, which
            is a major attraction here!

            Khirsu, which could be your ideal weekend spot and a reward for
